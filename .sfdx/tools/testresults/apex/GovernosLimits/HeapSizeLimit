/*total heap size limit its between 6MB and 12MB (size of RAM)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity
The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required
 to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. 
 It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.
 [1] This includes the memory space used by its inputs, called input space, and any other (auxiliary) memory it 
 uses during execution, which is called auxiliary space.
